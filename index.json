This new method, a refinement of the original seeding approach, is far less sensitive to the choice of order parameter for measuring the size of a nucleus. Consequently, it surpasses seeding in accuracy and umbrella sampling in computational speed. We test the method extensively and demonstrate excellent accuracy for crystal nucleation of nearly hard spheres and two distinct models of water: mW and TIP4P/ICE. This method can easily be extended to calculate nucleation barriers for homogeneous melting, condensation, and cavitation.","tags":[],"title":"Variational umbrella seeding for calculating nucleation barriers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willem Gispen","Marjolein Dijkstra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733998821,"objectID":"0d5bdaff76cbe7b547a8c0624c7eace5","permalink":"https://willemgispen.github.io/publication/gispen-finding-2024/","publishdate":"2024-12-12T10:20:21.555981Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gispen-finding-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"By employing brute-force molecular dynamics, umbrella sampling, and seeding simulations, we investigate homogeneous nucleation during melting and freezing of hard spheres. We provide insights into these opposing phase transitions from the standpoint of classical nucleation theory. We observe that melting has both a lower driving force and a lower interfacial tension than freezing. The lower driving force arises from the vicinity of a spinodal instability in the solid and from a strain energy. The lower interfacial tension implies that the Tolman lengths associated with melting and freezing have opposite signs, a phenomenon that we interpret with Turnbull’s rule. Despite these asymmetries, the nucleation rates for freezing and melting are found to be comparable.","tags":[],"title":"Finding the differences: Classical nucleation perspective on homogeneous melting and freezing of hard spheres","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willem Gispen","Marjolein Dijkstra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733998821,"objectID":"4506543c03cdc5eb5f4cb2d710fb714c","permalink":"https://willemgispen.github.io/publication/gispen-brute-force-2023/","publishdate":"2024-12-12T10:20:21.429033Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gispen-brute-force-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"We determine nucleation rates of hard spheres using brute-force molecular dynamics simulations.

Exploiting the seeding approach in extensive simulations, we calculate nucleation barrier heights for face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) phases for varying screening lengths and supersaturations. We determine for the entire metastable fluid region the crystal polymorph with the lowest nucleation barrier, and find a regime close to the triple point where metastable bcc can form due to a lower nucleation barrier, even though fcc is the stable phase. For higher supersaturation, we find that the difference in barrier heights decreases and we observe a mix of hexagonal close-packed, fcc, and bcc structures in the growth of crystalline seeds as well as in spontaneously formed crystals. Our kinetic phase diagram rationalizes the different crystallization mechanisms observed in previous work.","tags":[],"title":"Kinetic Phase Diagram for Nucleation and Growth of Competing Crystal Polymorphs in Charged Colloids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willem Gispen","Marjolein Dijkstra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733998821,"objectID":"7abc159d707d0a105a7dc3cd50bc189e","permalink":"https://willemgispen.github.io/publication/gispen-kinetic-2022/","publishdate":"2024-12-12T10:20:21.303098Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gispen-kinetic-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Kinetic Phase Diagram for Nucleation and Growth of Competing Crystal Polymorphs in Charged Colloids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Willem Gispen","Austen Lamacraft"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608827989,"objectID":"e59c93a37482ebad77e6a22d0c0beb54","permalink":"https://willemgispen.github.io/publication/gispen-2022-ground/","publishdate":"2022-08-24T16:39:49.813789Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gispen-2022-ground/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce reinforcement learning (RL) formulations of the problem of finding the ground state of a many-body quantum mechanical model defined on a lattice. We show that stoquastic Hamiltonians -- those without a sign problem -- have a natural decomposition into stochastic dynamics and a potential representing a reward function. The mapping to RL is developed for both continuous and discrete time, based on a generalized Feynman--Kac formula in the former case and a stochastic representation of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in the latter. We discuss the application of this mapping to the neural representation of quantum states, spelling out the advantages over approaches based on direct representation of the wavefunction of the system.","tags":null,"title":"Ground states of quantum many body lattice models via reinforcement learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ariel Barr","Willem Gispen","Austen Lamacraft"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601391673,"objectID":"a909fdfd5453a31a07c3044e5f1a2268","permalink":"https://willemgispen.github.io/publication/barr-quantum-2020/","publishdate":"2020-09-29T15:01:13.572842Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barr-quantum-2020/","section":"publication","summary":" Finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical system can be formulated as an optimal control problem. In this formulation, the drift of the optimally controlled process is chosen to match the distribution of paths in the Feynman–Kac (FK) representation of the solution of the imaginary time Schrödinger equation. This provides a variational principle that can be used for reinforcement learning of a neural representation of the drift. Our approach is a drop-in replacement for path integral Monte Carlo, learning an optimal importance sampler for the FK trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to several problems of one-, two-, and many-particle physics.","tags":[],"title":"Quantum ground states from reinforcement learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Muench","Barbara Wagner","Willem Gispen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"5a533c1bf371ac75ea683122136da30f","permalink":"https://willemgispen.github.io/publication/muench-self-consistent-2019/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T10:30:05.114097Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muench-self-consistent-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study we consider the self-consistent field theory for a dry, in- compressible polymer brush, densely grafted on a substrate, describing the average segment density of a polymer in terms of an effective chemical potential for the interaction between the segments of the polymer chain. We present a systematic singular perturbation analysis of the self-consistent field theory in the strong-stretching limit, when the length scale of the ratio of the radius of gyration of the polymer chain to the extension of the brush from the substrate vanishes. Our analysis yields, for the first time, an approximation for the average segment density that is correct to leading order in the outer scaling and resolves the boundary layer singularity at the end of the polymer brush in the strong-stretching limit. We also show that in this limit our analytical results agree increasingly well with our numerical solutions to the full model equations comprising the self-consistent field theory.","tags":null,"title":"Self-consistent field theory for a polymer brush","type":"publication"}]
