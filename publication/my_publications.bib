	abstract = {We introduce reinforcement learning (RL) formulations of the problem of finding the ground state of a many-body quantum mechanical model defined on a lattice. We show that stoquastic Hamiltonians -- those without a sign problem -- have a natural decomposition into stochastic dynamics and a potential representing a reward function. The mapping to RL is developed for both continuous and discrete time, based on a generalized Feynman--Kac formula in the former case and a stochastic representation of the Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation in the latter. We discuss the application of this mapping to the neural representation of quantum states, spelling out the advantages over approaches based on direct representation of the wavefunction of the system.},

	abstract = {In this study we consider the self-consistent field theory for a dry, in- compressible polymer brush, densely grafted on a substrate, describing the average segment density of a polymer in terms of an effective chemical potential for the interaction between the segments of the polymer chain. We present a systematic singular perturbation analysis of the self-consistent field theory in the strong-stretching limit, when the length scale of the ratio of the radius of gyration of the polymer chain to the extension of the brush from the substrate vanishes. Our analysis yields, for the first time, an approximation for the average segment density that is correct to leading order in the outer scaling and resolves the boundary layer singularity at the end of the polymer brush in the strong-stretching limit. We also show that in this limit our analytical results agree increasingly well with our numerical solutions to the full model equations comprising the self-consistent field theory.},

 abstract = { Finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical system can be formulated as an optimal control problem. In this formulation, the drift of the optimally controlled process is chosen to match the distribution of paths in the Feynman–Kac (FK) representation of the solution of the imaginary time Schrödinger equation. This provides a variational principle that can be used for reinforcement learning of a neural representation of the drift. Our approach is a drop-in replacement for path integral Monte Carlo, learning an optimal importance sampler for the FK trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to several problems of one-, two-, and many-particle physics.}
