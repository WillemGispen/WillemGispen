	abstract = {In this thesis, we try to clarify why the free energy of the square Ising model can be obtained. To do this, we take a somewhat historic approach by using the transfer matrix method. Subsequently, we derive the Kramers-Wannier duality and obtain the critical temperature. Lastly, we show how to apply the “Jordan-Wigner transformation” to fermionic operators to reduce the problem significantly. In our presentation of Kramers-Wannier duality and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, it will become clear that these two are in fact quite similar transformations.},

	abstract = {There is some numerical evidence that the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for dry polymer brushes converges to the strong stretching theory (SST) in the limit of strong stretching. However, the numerical results are restricted to moderately stretched brushes. We insert the SST prediction for the self-consistent field into the diffusion equations of SCFT and analyse them in the strong stretching limit using asymptotic analysis. The resulting asymptotic solution for the segment density shows that the self-consistency relation is not satisfied, not even approximately. Therefore, any future asymptotic treatment should include corrections to the SST prediction. Nevertheless, our asymptotic analysis is the first step towards asymptotic evidence that the SCFT converges to SST in the strong stretching limit.},
