	abstract = {In this thesis, we try to clarify why the free energy of the square Ising model can be obtained. To do this, we take a somewhat historic approach by using the transfer matrix method. Subsequently, we derive the Kramers-Wannier duality and obtain the critical temperature. Lastly, we show how to apply the “Jordan-Wigner transformation” to fermionic operators to reduce the problem significantly. In our presentation of Kramers-Wannier duality and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, it will become clear that these two are in fact quite similar transformations.},

	abstract = {In this study we consider the self-consistent field theory for a dry, in- compressible polymer brush, densely grafted on a substrate, describing the average segment density of a polymer in terms of an effective chemical potential for the interaction between the segments of the polymer chain. We present a systematic singular perturbation analysis of the self-consistent field theory in the strong-stretching limit, when the length scale of the ratio of the radius of gyration of the polymer chain to the extension of the brush from the substrate vanishes. Our analysis yields, for the first time, an approximation for the average segment density that is correct to leading order in the outer scaling and resolves the boundary layer singularity at the end of the polymer brush in the strong-stretching limit. We also show that in this limit our analytical results agree increasingly well with our numerical solutions to the full model equations comprising the self-consistent field theory.},

	title = {Quantum ground states from reinforcement learning},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Finding the ground state of a quantum mechanical system can be formulated as an optimal control problem. In this formulation, the drift of the optimally controlled process is chosen to match the distribution of paths in the Feynman--Kac (FK) representation of the solution of the imaginary time Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation. This provides a variational principle that can be used for reinforcement learning of a neural representation of the drift. Our approach is a drop-in replacement for path integral Monte Carlo, learning an optimal importance sampler for the FK trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to several problems of one-, two-, and many-particle physics.},
