 abstract = {In this thesis, we try to clarify why the free energy of the square Ising model can be obtained. To do this, we take a somewhat historic approach by using the transfer matrix method. Subsequently, we derive the Kramers-Wannier duality and obtain the critical temperature. Lastly, we show how to apply the “Jordan-Wigner transformation” to fermionic operators to reduce the problem significantly. In our presentation of Kramers-Wannier duality and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, it will become clear that these two are in fact quite similar transformations.},
