 abstract = {There is some numerical evidence that the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) for dry polymer brushes converges to the strong stretching theory (SST) in the limit of strong stretching. However, the numerical results are restricted to moderately stretched brushes. We insert the SST prediction for the self-consistent field into the diffusion equations of SCFT and analyse them in the strong stretching limit using asymptotic analysis. The resulting asymptotic solution for the segment density shows that the self-consistency relation is not satisfied, not even approximately. Therefore, any future asymptotic treatment should include corrections to the SST prediction. Nevertheless, our asymptotic analysis is the first step towards asymptotic evidence that the SCFT converges to SST in the strong stretching limit.},
